                <p>While children are not mature enough to participate in the intensive training process needed for the successful placement of a Seizure Response Dog (which is what most agencies train), 4 Paws believes that their is still room for a dog to help a child with seizures. Parents can use a Seizure Assistance Dog as a tool in helping keep their child safe, and the benefits of having a dog as a companion and friend are priceless.</p>

                <p>Seizure Assistance Dogs can provide a measure of comfort for children who have seizures. They can provide a distraction during unpleasant medical procedures, such as blood tests, and can be used to help comfort a child during therapy sessions. Children with seizures may be afraid of being alone, sleeping in their own beds, and engaging in activities because they might have a seizure. In these instances, dogs can give the children a little courage while helping them maintain their independence.</p>
