                <p>The Autism Assistance Dog offered at 4 Paws is the first known to have tracking skills. We were the first agency to train and place highly skilled Autism Assistance Dogs with families.</p>

                <p>The Fetal Alcohol Spectrum(FASD)/Drug Exposure(DE) Assistance Dog is a placement program that was developed here at 4 Paws. We were the first agency to place highly skilled assistance dogs with children with FASD, and as far as we have seen, the only agency making these placements specifically trained for kids on the FASD spectrum and/or exposed to drugs prenatally.</p> 

                <p>Autism Assistance Dogs and FASD/DE Assistance Dogs are similarly trained. They help parents and children manage their behaviour and otherwise make life easier.  Some of the ways they are trained to help are (but are not limited to):
                    <ul>
                        <li>Behaviour disruption and interruption, </li>
                        <li>Scent specific training to help locate child,</li>
                        <li>Improving social and communication skills,</li>
                        <li>Offering a calming influence,</li>
                        <li>Increasing independence for the child,</li>
                        <li>Providing a stable relationship.</li>
                    </ul>
