                <p>There are many tools to use in dealing with diabetes, and the Diabetic Alert Dog is one more tool to add to the toolbox used to help families deal with their child who has diabetes. With the use of a Diabetic Alert Dog the child can gain the independence they need as they grow up and mature and the parents are not afraid to allow them to do so. </p>

                <p>As with all medical alert dogs, Diabetic Alert Dogs are trained to smell the chemical body changes that occur as insulin levels increase or decrease. With the right training in scent-based work, a Diabetic Alert Dog is able to respond to those chemical changes long before any adverse medical reactions can occur. They are trained to alert parents or caregivers to the change as soon as it happens. The parents and/or child are then able to check their blood sugar level and take appropriate action.</p>
