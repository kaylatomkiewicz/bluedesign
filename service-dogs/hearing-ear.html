            <p> For people with hearing impairment, the absence of sound can be life-threatening. Hearing Ear Dogs learn to respond to verbal and hand signals and are taught to work for toys and affection. Hearing Ear Dogs are trained to alert their owners to a variety of different sounds. When the dog hears any of the noises they are trained to recognize, they get their owners attention and lead them to the sound.</p>

            <p>Hearing Ear Dogs can be a bridge providing more opportunities for their owners to socialize while out and about in a “hearing” world. People with hearing impairments who use a Hearing Ear Dog report that they feel better equipped to function in the outside world.</p>

            <p>Hearing Aid Dogs are trained to work in any situation. Some of the sounds these dogs can be trained to respond to include (but are not limited to):
                <ul>
                    <li>Someone knocking at the door, </li>
                    <li>Doorbells,</li>
                    <li>Alarm clocks,</li>
                    <li>Telephones,</li>
                    <li>Smoke detectors,</li>
                    <li>Someone calling their owner’s name,</li>
                    <li>Police and emergency vehicle sirens.</li>
                </ul>
