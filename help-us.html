         <h3 class="red-title">Sponsor</h3>

        <p>We would love to count on you to be a sponsor. There are so many ways you can make a difference in the lives of children with disabilities!</p>

        <p>While in some situations, we place more than one dog over time, many families can benefit from one dog dually trained to mitigate the disability of more than one child within the home. You can sponsor—among other things—one of the facility cats, a dog in prison, or a child in need of an assistance dog.</p>
