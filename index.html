    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>4 Paws was founded in 1998 by Karen Shirk after she tried unsuccessfully for years to obtain a service dog from traditional service dog agencies. At the time, Karen often used a ventilator to breathe and the agencies she applied to found her too disabled to receive a service dog. After obtaining her own dog and finding the training herself, Karen dreamed of a place where applicants for service dogs were not judged based on severity of disability and set out to start her own organization. Her dream became the large, thriving, respected nonprofit organization 4 Paws for Ability is today!</p>

    <p>We had humble beginnings with two dogs in a one-bedroom apartment in October of 1998. Initially Karen contracted trainers to do the actual service dog work. The first few years were slow and Karen worked with a small number of people needing dogs within her own community.</p>

    <p>Within a few years it became evident to her that no one seemed to be training skilled service dogs with public access for young children. Most agencies would not work with kids at all or would give them companion dogs for use in the home. A few would place the dogs who flunked out of their adult programs with kids for use in the home. Karen felt a calling to work with these kids and with the help of the Internet and a newly formed website, she began to let people know she would help regardless of age. It was at that time that business began to boom and 4 Paws was growing at as much as 300% in a year'92s time.</p>

    <p class="pad-bottom-double">Today, placing approximately 100 dogs a year, 4 Paws For Ability is the largest organization whose primary mission is to place service dogs with children and one of the only organizations to have no minimum age requirements. We place almost every type of service dog available and never turn down a child who does not '93fit'94 into one of the traditional service dog categories. Our Multipurpose Assistance Dog is a dog that encompasses all those children who do not fit into the traditional service dog types and/or who have disabilities that fit into more than one type of dog trained.</p>

    <p class="pad-bottom-double">Our primary goals are to provide as many children as possible, within the scope of our ability to serve, and with disabilities falling under the definition of such in the Americans with Disability Act (1990) with access to a qualified service dog trained specifically for their needs, with no minimum age , and regardless of the severity of the disability. We also want to increase public awareness of the laws regarding service animals and the value they provide their owners.</p>

    <h3>What Makes 4 Paws Unique</h3> 
    <p class="pad-bottom-double">We have faster turnaround time for training and receipt of a service dog. The process typically takes 12 '96 18 months from start to finish with 9 '96 12 months of this being after the funds are raised. These months (9 '96 12) are the months the dog is in training. The waiting period for most service dog organizations is 3 or more years. We welcome challenges. 4 Paws is willing to reach out and tackle the more difficult placements. We have a 90% success rate with the first dog placed in the home and an overall success rate of 98%. We also have flexible training for our dogs. Training can provide unique and highly customized kinds of placements. We work with people nationwide rather than just in our region. 4 Paws has no minimal age requirement and does not discriminate based on severity of disability within the programs it provides. 4 Paws also does not require that recipients give up their pets to receive a service dog as many agencies do.</p>
