This provides increased independence for the children, and assistance to their families. And 4 Paws also works with veterans from recent conflicts who’ve lost the use of their limbs or their hearing while in active combat. In all cases, the results speak for themselves.">

<h3>Donate</h3>

<h3>Volunteer</h3>

<p>We need help, and if you’re not too busy, consider being part of our volunteer task force! This is a highly rewarding way to become involved in community service!</p>

<p>Some of the types of needs we have at 4 Paws for Ability headquarters include (but are not limited to) the following:
	<ul>
		<li>Dog care,</li>
		<li>Socialization of puppies,</li>
		<li>Basic training with puppies and rescues,</li>

<p>Contact us now if you’d like to make a difference in the lives of families with disabilities by giving of your time and talent.</p>

<h3>Sponsor</h3>

<p>We would love to count on you to be a sponsor. There are so many ways you can make a difference in the lives of children with disabilities!</p>

<p>While in some situations, we place more than one dog over time, many families can benefit from one dog dually trained to mitigate the disability of more than one child within the home. You can sponsor—among other things—one of the facility cats, a dog in prison, or a child in need of an assistance dog.</p>
